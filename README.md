# Relational analysis between the Carbon dioxide emission with GDP per capita and Power consumption of the country  
As a part of my coursera certification capstone project I have done relational study between CO_{2}
In this project we study the relational analysis between carbon dioxide emission and GDP per capita. 
\[
E = mc^2
\]
This formula states that the equivalent energy ($E$)
can be calculated as the mass ($m$) multiplied
by the speed of light ($c$) squared
